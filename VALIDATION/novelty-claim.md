## What We Found (Related But Distinct)

### Ant Colony Optimization (ACO)
- **Status:** Well-established field
- **Focus:** Routing, scheduling, combinatorial optimization
- **Gap:** Not applied to LLM context or memory

### Memory-Augmented Transformers
- **Status:** Active research (Google Titans, etc.)
- **Focus:** Architectural changes to attention mechanisms
- **Gap:** Requires model retraining, not orchestration layer

### RAG Systems
- **Status:** Production use
- **Focus:** Vector similarity retrieval
- **Gap:** No decay dynamics, no usage-based strengthening

### Neural-Symbolic Hybrids
- **Status:** Academic research
- **Focus:** Combining neural networks with symbolic AI
- **Gap:** Different paradigm, not pheromone-inspired

## Our Unique Contribution

### Novel Elements

1. **Pheromone decay applied to context** — No prior art
2. **Trail strengthening based on usage patterns** — No prior art
3. **SEED compression for context regeneration** — No prior art
4. **PRISM refraction for personalized output** — No prior art
5. **Orchestration layer (not architecture)** — Differentiated from Titans

### Why This Matters

This isn't incremental improvement. It's a new approach.

| Existing Research | Our Contribution |
|-------------------|------------------|
| Store more context | Navigate context via trails |
| Bigger context windows | Compressed seed regeneration |
| Vector similarity | Pheromone-strength retrieval |
| Model-level changes | Orchestration layer |

## Limitations of This Scan

### What We Covered
- arXiv (primary AI research repository)
- Major conferences (NeurIPS, ICML, ACL references)
- Google Scholar cross-reference

### What We Didn't Cover
- Private industry research (unpublished)
- Patents (separate IP search recommended)
- Non-English publications
- Papers published after December 15, 2025

### Recommendation
Before major investment, conduct formal patent search and expand to additional databases.

## Scan Date

**Completed:** December 15, 2025  
**Researcher:** Project 848 Team  
**Tools Used:** arXiv API, manual review, cross-reference verification

---

## Conclusion

Within the scope of publicly available AI research, Project 848's pheromone-inspired memory protocols represent **novel, unpublished work** with no direct prior art.

This positions the research for:
- Academic publication (arXiv, peer review)
- Patent protection (provisional recommended)
- First-mover advantage in AI memory orchestration
