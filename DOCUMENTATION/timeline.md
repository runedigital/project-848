# Timeline — The 4-Week Journey

*From concept to validated research: November 18 → December 15, 2025*

---

## Week 1: Discovery (Nov 18-24)

### Day 1-2: Problem Identification
- Identified context fragmentation as fundamental AI pain point
- Researched existing solutions (RAG, fine-tuning, context windows)
- Noted gaps in current approaches

### Day 3-4: Biological Inspiration
- Discovered ant colony pheromone dynamics
- Initial hypothesis: apply decay gradients to AI memory
- Named concept "pheromone-inspired memory"

### Day 5-7: Framework Design
- Designed three-layer architecture (SEED-ANT-PRISM)
- Defined core primitives (trails, decay, regeneration, refraction)
- Created initial documentation

**Week 1 Output:** Conceptual framework, hypothesis documented

---

## Week 2: Validation (Nov 25 - Dec 1)

### Day 8-10: Prior Art Scan
- Defined search methodology
- Executed 11 queries across arXiv
- Scanned 193 papers
- Result: Zero prior art matches

### Day 11-12: H-010 Experiment
- Applied ANT protocol to timeline prediction
- Tested against known outcomes
- Result: 100% accuracy on major milestones

### Day 13-14: KINGSLAYER Experiment
- Applied decay gradients to market signals
- Tested against historical events
- Result: Detected SVB signals 3 days early

**Week 2 Output:** Novelty verified, protocols validated

---

## Week 3: Data & Documentation (Dec 2-8)

### Day 15-17: Dataset Collection
- Began systematic conversation data collection
- Standardized format across models
- Quality control processes

### Day 18-19: Protocol Documentation
- Wrote detailed SEED-ANT-PRISM specifications
- Created public/private documentation strategy
- Prepared for external communication

### Day 20-21: Investor Materials
- Created pitch deck structure
- Drafted one-pager
- Prepared talking points

**Week 3 Output:** 27.9GB dataset, documentation complete

---

## Week 4: Launch Prep (Dec 9-15)

### Day 22-24: Website & Branding
- Designed visual identity (VERTEX imagery)
- Built single-page website
- Created brand assets

### Day 25-26: Repository Setup
- Created dual-repo structure (public/private)
- Populated documentation
- Set up access controls

### Day 27: Final Polish
- Website live
- Repos public
- Pitch ready for submission

**Week 4 Output:** Launch-ready assets, public presence

## Why 4 Weeks?

This timeline demonstrates:

1. **Protocol Effectiveness** — We used SEED-ANT-PRISM to build SEED-ANT-PRISM faster
2. **ADHD Optimization** — Novel problem-solving excels with constraint
3. **Democratization Proof** — Non-ML-expert to validated research in 27 days
4. **Execution Velocity** — Speed-to-insight is part of the value proposition

## What's Next?

### Month 1-2 (Dec 2025 - Jan 2026)
- Blackbird pitch response
- Academic paper submission
- Additional VC outreach

### Month 2-3 (Jan-Feb 2026)
- First enterprise pilots
- Peer review feedback
- CMD School MVP design

### Month 3-6 (Feb-May 2026)
- Production implementation
- First revenue
- Team expansion
